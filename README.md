## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned

In this project, I improved my skills in:  

- Writing **semantic HTML** for better accessibility.  
- Using **Flexbox** for responsive layouts.  
- Making a card component look consistent across devices.  
- Adding **hover effects** with smooth transitions for better UX.  

Example code snippet I’m proud of:  

```css
.add-to-cart {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 0.75rem;
  background-color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: none;
  font-weight: 700;
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  cursor: pointer;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 10px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}


### Continued development

In the future, I want to focus more on:

1. Exploring CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
2. Improving accessibility features (better alt texts, ARIA labels).
3. Experimenting with dark mode support.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - Helped me with structuring the layout.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Great place to see how others solved the challenge.
